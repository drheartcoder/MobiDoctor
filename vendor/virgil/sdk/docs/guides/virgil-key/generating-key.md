# Generating Keys

This guide shows how to generate a Virgil Key.  The Virgil Key is a Private Key, which never leaves its device. It allows only those who hold the key to sign data and decrypt data that was encrypted with the Private Key's associated Public Key.

Set up your project environment before you begin to generate a Virgil Key, with the [getting started](/docs/guides/configuration/client-configuration.md) guide.

The Virgil Key generation procedure is shown in the figure below.

There are two options to generate a Virgil Key:
- With the default key pair type
- With a specific key pair type


1. To generate a Virgil Key with the default type:


- Developers need to initialize the **Virgil SDK**

```php
$virgilApi = VirgilApi::create('[YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE]');
```

- Then Alice generates a new Virgil Key

```php
$aliceKey = $virgilApi->Keys->generate();
```

**Warning**: Virgil doesn't keep a copy of your Virgil Key. If you lose a Virgil Key, there is no way to recover it.

2. To generate a Virgil Key with a specific type, we need to:


- Choose the preferred type and initialize **Virgil Crypto** with this type;
- Initialize the Virgil SDK with a custom Virgil Crypto instance;
- Generate a new Virgil Key.

```php
// create context with specified key pair type.
$virgilApiContext = VirgilApiContext::create(
    [
        VirgilApiContext::KeyPairType => KeyPairTypes::EC_BP512R1,
    ]
);

// initialize a High Level API class with specified context.
$virgilApi = new VirgilApi($virgilApiContext);

// generate alice key with KeyPairTypes::EC_BP512R1 key pair type.
$aliceKey = $virgilApi->Keys->generate();
```

Developers can also generate a Private Key using the Virgil CLI.
