# Creating Signature

This guide is a short tutorial on how to create a **Digital Signature** with Virgil Security. A valid digital signature gives a recipient reason to believe that the message was created by a known sender, that the sender cannot deny having sent the message, and that the message was not altered in transit. It can be used with any kind of message â€“ whether it is encrypted or not.

See our [Use Cases](/docs/get-started) to find out what you can do with Digital Signature.

Set up your project environment before starting to create a Digital Signature, with the [getting started](/docs/guides/configuration/client-configuration.md) guide.

The **Signature Creation** procedure is shown in the figure below.

In order to create a Digital Signature and sign the message, Alice has to have her Virgil Key.


Let's review the **Digital Signature** creation process:

- Developers need to initialize the **Virgil SDK**

```php
$virgilApi = VirgilApi::create('[YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE]');
```

- Load Alice's Virgil Key from the protected storage and enter the Virgil Key password;

```php
// load Alice's Key from storage
$aliceKey = $virgilApi->Keys->load('[KEY_NAME]', '[KEY_PASSWORD]');
```

To load the Virgil Key  from a specific storage, developers need to change the storage path during Virgil SDK initialization.

Then Alice has to:
- Prepare the information for the message to Bob
- Sign the message using her Virgil Key

```php
// load Alice's Key from storage
$aliceKey = $virgilApi->Keys->load('[KEY_NAME]', '[KEY_PASSWORD]');

$message = 'Hey Bob, hope you are doing well.';

// generate signature of the message using Alice's key
$aliceSignature = $aliceKey->sign($message);
```

See our guide on [Loading Keys](/docs/guides/virgil-key/loading-key.md) for more examples.

Alice can now send a signed message to Bob.
